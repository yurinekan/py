They were pretty rowdy there.","I don't remember seeing many scraps at the minor league park.  It was close a couple times and both benches cleared but the umps got it under control in time.","I don't remember seeing any fights at the Yankee games.

Like I saw that one armed pitcher Jim Abbott pitch a no hitter for 8 innings until it was broken up by a hit by Bo Jackson of the White Sox.","For sure.  If you got there at the right time they would let you go to the monument park and look at the bronze plaques  That was pretty cool too.  Nothing like going to the old ball game!","Cool. It must have been nice to be in that park.  I liked the minor league games as they were much cheaper to attend and sometimes big stars would play in rehab games or appear.","It does cost to go to the show.  That game I saw a Yankee steal home successfully.  Almost couldn't believe what i was looking at.","Reggie Jackson came to the minor league park as an attraction after he retired and put on a home run show.  He must have hit the ball about 500 feet about 15 times in towering drives.  That was cool.","Neat.  A few weeks after the Abbott game they played the Indians and that time he made a no hitter.  That was awesome.  What a thrill to see such a special game.","I bet.  The minor league games I attended were very fast paced and the players seemed to go full tilt for the whole game.  What some of them lacked in talent they made up for wit hustle and guts.","I was lucky in that we scored tickets from a well connected friend.  It lasted for a few years and all I needed to do was pay for food and the seats were great.","The minor league games were fun.  I remember there were a group of people in the upper deck that always wore aviators goggles and hats.","",""

The Negro League teams usually did very well in them.","Many great players never played in the majors due to the color barrier and racism.  It was nice that the Hall of Fame devoted a wing to the old Negro Leagues and some of the great players from that era.","Who was the last batter to hit over .400?  The averages seem to have gone down as the homers increased.","That would be Ted Williams in 1941.  He was up there on the all time home run list about 521.  He had a high average for his lifetime too,","Yeah, he homered in his last at bat at age 42.  He sure went out with a bang and hit about .320 even at that age.","He was a remarkable player who went his own way.  Spent 5 years in the military in two wars.  Fighter pilot.  I guess he was a real life Superman if there ever was one!","Sure thing, its impossible to say who the greatest player ever is.  He would certainly be one of them.","Baseball has a remarkable history and surely was/is a national pastime.  It's hard to figure the salaries.  Now big stars get over 20 million a season with many perks.","Sure, guys like Mickey Mantle, for example made about 100,000 per year tops.  Even though it was years ago it is just hard to figure out.  Were the owners making that much back then?","Cool.  I read about many of those guys and remember seeing quite a few grainy films of them playing.","That's a complicated issue.  I just liked seeing guys like Ty Cobb sliding hard into base.  Most of the players today aren't so aggressive.  Don't want to get hurt.  The old timers sure were a tough group.","Back then in the early twentieth century If you hit 10 home runs that was awesome.  They seemed to play more for strategy and stealing bases.","Plus the ball was not lively like today.  The ball was wrapped much looser and could not travel as far when hit.","It didn't fly off of the end of the bat like they do now, to hit it over the fence took incredible power and many homers were inside the park ones.","Those guys could really run and hit, there were higher batting averages then too.  They really played as a team to win, double steals, hit and run, bunting.","Then the Bambino came and tore up the league with his power hitting and he was an awesome pitcher as well.  Quite a sensation he was.","Yeah, Boston was mad that he was sold to the Yankees.  Around then the ball was wrapped tighter and began to fly off of the bat.","Sure, the owners realized that fans liked the home runs and they wanted to please to get more fans in the seats.  Then the money came rolling in.","",""
