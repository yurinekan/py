Plus, theres no real consquencs.. guy shouldve been arrested or fined for that type of behavior.. throwing stuff on the field is dangerous.","Also all that drama against the red sox was ridiculous too.. throwing balls at each other, cussing each other out.. what are they, toddlers?","I know, I hope that their managers got em straightened out so all that bs can stop and the O's can focus on the game. They are doing to well to ruin their season with crap like that.","no players needs intentional throwing, it can be detrimental to anyone.

Not sure how thats going to go based on reports.","But the team stayed in the family, so thats a good thing- you know when new owners come on, its always difficult for the players.. and it affects the game.","Have you ever been to Comerica Park?

That being said, I think the MLB team would have at least a couple of off nights. So no, I don't think they could win 50+ straight.","Talent gap isn't much different overall from each college to pro sport but baseball is certainly the easiest sport for a college team to beat a pro team.","College teams regularly compete well with pro teams in exhibition games, so while its possible for a pro team to go undefeated on a tough college schedule, its still more unlikely than likely.","College players play in off-season leagues with minor league teams all the time and they often beat them. And not just D1 college players... I'm talking D2 and D3 also.","College has a ton of players who are there to play College baseball. And their dream ends.","There are still examples of college teams winning exhibition games against pro teams. Granted those teams are frequently made up of minor league players.","The MLB team would be favored in each game, but the odds would probably be against them going 60-0 or whatever the total number of games would be for a season.","With all this talk aside, I would pay a lot of money to see a game like this played.","Likewise, but I still think your delusional if you think a NCAA college baseball team will have any chance at beating an MLB team on the field.","Ehhhh who really knows. We'll never get the chance to actually witness a game like that being played.","All it takes is one hot pitcher","Indeed. Very true.","My brother said no. He also said LSU would beat the Astros one game out of 50. I think the gap is too large between college/professional baseball. Thoughts?","Your brother is correct. It would only be one game out of 50, but it would happen.","The talent gap is so large. Idk official statistics, but I'd be willing to bet 6 out of 9 starters on a college team won't make it to AA ball. Every starter on an MLB team is one of the best players in the world. I think they'd run through the schedule. Hitting/Pitching is so much more advanced.","The talent differential would be night and day. But even if you give the pros a 98% chance of winning each game, they only have a 36% of winning 50 straight. If you bump it to 99%, it is a 60% chance.","All things being equal, the worst MLB team wouldn't lose more than 2 games. Given that the NCAA team uses wooden bats or the MLB team uses aluminum bats.","If it's 100% on the same playing field there is no chance. Guys like Altuve, Trout or Harper would hit close to .550 with a metal bat against NCAA pitching.","Think a team like LSU, with really good fielding, would almost definitely win one in 50. All it takes is one game where the MLB team gee unlucky on balls in play and the MLB pitcher has control issues","",""

Stride is to get that motion going and at the same time start the arm cocking or extend your arm back to start the forward motion.","That's what it's called? really?","Yep. And as the stride ends, the foot plants on the ground, the arm stretched back will start to move forward, and this is the start of the release phase.

Its totally common for even really good left handed hitters to struggle against LHP but he should be mashing right handers.","I mean, Schwarber comes with some higher expectations because he was an elite college bat.","But he was the 2nd best college hitter in that draft and he needed to be sent down after initial success when the league made adjustments to him.","Usually the top college bat in a draft ends up being a pretty solid hitter in the big leagues, and what minor league and MLB numbers have shown so far, he does appear to be legit.","I would certainly move him down in the order, maybe see if that can take that pressure off of him batting leadoff until he starts to find his groove.","I think Schwarber will be fine offensively","So its that its early and he will rebound?","I do think so. He's also been in the league exactly long enough, that the league knows his profile as a hitter now and are exploiting any weaknesses he may have.","He has to adjust back.","Slow start after missing basically a full season and adjusting to a new position seems like a pretty reasonable explanation.","He will, don't throw him under the bus just yet.","No doubting his long term potential but after 115 PA, he's only slugging .330 and he's striking out over 30% of the time.","That it is really really hard to hit in this league. I think he'll be fine and adjust. The league has learned some of his hot spots, and he'll adjust and be perfectly fine.","I'm not doubting that he'll rebound this season as well. My question is does anyone notice anything mechanically or perhaps were expectations too high coming into this season?","I mean, I think he's a .275/.360/.475 hitter this year, and more power in future years.","I don't question that he'll finish well and that its just a bad month but sometimes the struggles come from injury, a noticeable change in mechanics, etc.","Schwarber will get going. Although I personally don't know if he will ever be that superstar that his bat has the potential to be. I think he will be a solid 3 WAR guy.

I have quite a few ideas myself.","Sure for quite some time there were so many players that suddenly came to camp looking like the Incredible Hulk.  It was in all of the sports to some extent.  You can't really blame the athletes too much as they all wanted to achieve stardom, do it better and faster, be stronger to dominate","Yes, and many looked the other way as the hulks were drawing crowds with their exploits.  The players to really admire during this period are ones like Derek Jeter who never touched the stuff and played outstanding ball for a generation.","Absolutely, and it seems the ones that got caught up in the steroids are not getting into the Hall of Fame too fast either.","Yeah, guys like Mickey Mantle were pretty big but he was naturally with a great physique.  I guess the only thing you could say about him is that he hurt himself by drinking too much and didn't take very good care of himself.","Back to the great players.  There were a lot of great pitchers.  Of the more modern era I liked Nolan Ryan, with all those strikeouts.","Sure, He had a hundred mile an hour fastball and threw it until he retired in his late forties somehow.  He was very intimidating to the batters.","He wasn't known for hitting batters on purpose, the fast pitch was hard enough to hit and he was a tough guy but a pretty good sport.","One that did not get much notoriety was Hoyt  Wilhelm.  He didn't make the majors until his late 20's from his war service and was best known as a n awesome relief pitcher.","I think he hit a home run in his first big league at bat and had a screwball that was almost impossible to hit.  I don't know how many saves he had but i think he played until he was almost 50.","Now the pitchers usually only pitch for a few innings and are pulled for specialists like mid inning relievers and closers.  They usually only allow them to throw a certain number of pitches then pull them out to not strain them.","Wow, that is a hot topic that would have plenty of good arguments.  I could only say fro sure that the most winning team was the Yankees. Great players mostly have great statistics","Well, I think the greatest of all time was Babe Ruth as he was a great pitcher who turned outfielder so he could play and hit every day.  He was another one that lived too fast and did his body harm from that.  I guess the argument would go on forever as long as the game will be played..","Sure, the hall of fame is full of players with high statistics that were consistent.  I would go with Ted Williams as the greatest hitter, although he was an average player in the field.  Then there are the players in the dead ball era.","There were quite a few players at and above Williams' level. How about Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth?","They were both quite fantastic in their times and there was much excitement and controversy around their careers and styles. I also liked Hank Aaron","Sure, he had the numbers and was very consistent for about 22 seasons.  The only controversy was when he approached the home run record.  Sadly, there was a lot of hating going on.","He was a good fielder and all around player.  A strong role model as well.  A credit to any team and someone to look up to.
