The pressure definitely got to him.","You don't believe in Mitch Trubisky?","I haven't seen him play a game yet! I've just watched the college highlights but I'm not sold on him being much of an improvement for the Bears.","Anything at this point has to be better then Jay Cutler right?","Jay Cutler gets a bad reputation from all the media news but he's been solid quarterback for the Bears.","He's been terrible! I know you're a Bears fan but you have to admit he's one of the worse quarterbacks in the league the past years.","I know the public perception of him has been bad and the Bears record has been awful but people forget we play in a tough division.","I'll give you the Green Bay Packers as being tough and the Minnesota Vikings when Adrian Peterson was there, even the Detroit Lions as a tough opponent but it's not like the NFC East.","x",""

It seems opponents can easily get into his head. Previous years when they played Carolina when Josh Norman was there, he disrupted Odell's concentration a lot.","He continued doing that, Josh Norman that is, in Washington.","That's right Josh Norman is on the Redskins now.","I think Odell needs to really grow up and be a true professional. Look at how Julio carries himself on the field and off the field, that's the type of leader and star wide receiver you want.","I see your point, I'm just really excited about Odell's big play potential. He's so entertaining to watch because you don't know when he's going to do something that'll just blow your mind.","In a few more years we'll see if Odell lives up to this early potential and hype. I think if he does mature he'll get there.","I'm not really sold on Eli Manning as the Giants quarterback going forward. He's so inconsistent in his performances for me.","That's been Eli's game though. You can criticize it but at the end of the day he's still a two time Superbowl Champion and seems to be Tom Brady's kryptonite.","It's amazing isn't it how Eli always seems to have Tom Brady's number when they match up in the big game.","In previous years this question would be a tough answer but I think in current years it's an easy choice. I take Julio Jones.","Eli also did that without Julio Jones level wide receivers in those Superbowls. He made average wide receivers look better then they were.","You would take Julio Jones easily over Odell Beckham Jr.?","Right now, yes, definitely because Julio has proven himself as an elite NFL wide receiver. The numbers he's put up in Atlanta for the Falcons the past years have been phenomenal!","You don't think it's due to having a talented and skilled quarterback like Matt Ryan?","I think Matt Ryan helps a lot of course, but let's not overlook how quick and big Julio is. There is no defensive coverage that can shut him down, and no cornerback can cover him one on one!","I like Odell Beckham Jr. I would take him but I completely understand you taking Julio Jones.","I like Odell too but he's still too young. Just because he made some eye opening, jaw dropping, amazing catches doesn't solidify him in my eyes as being on Julio's level just yet.","I can understand that.

And how did the Titans...and then Jets...do in their early years? were they very good?","no, they were not.  they had some mediocre years and some bad years until they drafted the legendary Joe Namath.  That changed the whole franchise and made the team noteworthy.","I've seen some highlight films of Namath and i've also seen him interviewed many times.  He was quite a personality, wasn't he?","He was a fabulous quarterback and he certainly had that confidence that the fans loved so much.","So as soon as Namath joined the team, they were a great team, right?","Actually, no.  Far from it.  the team struggled when Namath got there but they improved gradually until the magical 1968 season.","1968...that was when they won their first super bowl, wasn't it? against the Colts?","Yes, and no.  it was against the Colts, but it wasn't their first super bowl...it's their only super bowl.","what? no wonder you don't want people to know you root for the Jets.  one super bowl in over half a century of games?","shhh...don't speak so loudly.  it's not something i'm proud of and i don't want people to hear me admit it, but yes, i am a long time Jets fan.","now you understand why their nickname is ""gang green.""  it was their only super bowl win, and in fact their only super bowl appearance.  it's not an easy team to root for, but I continue to root for them.  i'm not sure what that says about me, but i'm looking forward to this season.","I'm a Jets fan too, but i've only followed them for a few seasons so i'm not really familiar with the team's history. can you fill me in?","well, the Jets were originally called the Titans...absolutely no connection with the Tennessee franchise.  they were the Titans for two seasons and played their home games in the old Polo Grounds until the moved into Shea Stadium as the Jets a few years later.","Wow! i never knew their original name was the Titans.  And the Polo Grounds? Are you serious? that was a real stadium?","It sure was.  it was the home of the baseball Giants; the team that moved to San Francisco.  In fact, it's where the Mets played before moving into Shea Stadium, but that's another story.","So the Jets came into existence in 1960, as I understand it...and originally they were in the old American Football League?","that's right.  they were one of the teams in the old A.F.L. that eventually merged with the National Football League.","So the Jets weren't an expansion team because they entered the A.F.L. when the league was brand new?","x",""

Why do you think that?","I think it's basically the same team as last year and coach Adam Gase isn't a great coach in my opinion.","I think they're going to win at least 10 games. Ryan Tannehill looked good last season and he's only going to get better.","I like Tannehill and I think the Dolphins' wide receivers have a lot of speed but they're not the best receivers in the game.","They spread the field and stretched it quite a bit last year. I loved it when they aired it out. Tannehill is impressive when he has full control of the offense.","There's more to being a good wide receiver than just speed. You need to have really high field IQ and I don't see any of the current wide receivers having that kind of game feel.","It's really disappointing that Arian Foster didn't work out for them last season.","x",""

How does the QB choose?","Well, the QB reads the outside rush and, if they bite on the run and move to stop the RB, he keeps it, if they move to sack him then he hands it off.","It sounds like every play should be the option, I have no idea how to defend against it.","Well, it rests on discipline of the defensive team.

The movie Moneyball wit Brad Pitt does a great job illustrating the power of data to optimize team configurations and strategies. These same principles are being applied to the NFL","Speaking of collect player data, have you seen the movie Concussion with Will Smith?","Yes that is an excellent movie that presents the effects of head injury on football player performance, health outcomes, mental health outcomes, criminal behavior, and mortality rates.","Yes I was shocked to see in that movie that some of the players who have history of repeatedly being tackled and sustaining head injuries beginning to abuse drugs and engaging in self-harmful behaviors","Yes it is true the movie Concussion is a well crafted non-fictional account of the development of the diagnosis for Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy due to amyloid plaques building up in the brain after concussion. The plaques cause significant neural cell death which causes a decline in cognitive function, memory, judgement, and decision making in NFL football players","The movie does an interesting job of highlighting the role of the NFL in trying to censor and ignore the problems of head injury in football.","Hey James, the 49ers were not doing so well I agree, without Colin Kaepernick the team seems to be really suffering","I believe the NFL is a great business, but sometimes its bottom-line priorities may interfere and conflict with protecting the health of the players.
