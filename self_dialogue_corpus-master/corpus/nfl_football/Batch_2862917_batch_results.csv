However, their defense is probably worse situated than Tampa Bay.","I disagree. Luke Kuechly is still one of the best linebackers in the league and they have many underrated players like Shaq Thompson.","But their secondary has never fully recovered since Josh Norman left for the Washington Redskins.

It's funny though that neither of us picked the defending NFC Champion Atlanta Falcons.","Do you think it's likely that for the third time in three years, the NFC South will have an average quarterback come out of nowhere and dominate the league?","When you put it like that, it sounds unlikely. However, he has an elite receiving core with the addition of DeSean Jackson.","Jackson is an excellent deep threat and I predict that he will complement Mike Evans.

I'm still surprised you chose Mahomes though.","I don't necessarily believe that he has the highest ceiling of this rookie class, but I think that having Andy Reid has his head coach positions him well for success.","I like Andy Reid a lot, but Mahomes never ran a pro-style offense at Texas Tech. Why do you think he'll be able to pick it up quickly in the NFL?","The good thing for Mahomes is that he doesn't need to pick it up too quickly because the Chiefs have a reliable veteran in Alex Smith.","Fair point, we'll see who's right once we're in the season.","Yeah, who do you have as your top rookie quarterback going into the season.","I know that this is unusual, but I think that DeShone Kizer has the most potential of anyone from this rookie class.","",""

Fantasy football, watching shows about football, listening to podcasts about football, I'm ready for it all.

Hearing offseason stories like Tom Brady's wife saying he has had multiple concussions but never appearing on the injury report for them is concerning.","I agree.  It's scary hearing about all the retired players suffering from CTE and the recent story about Warren Sapp feeling like he is already dealing with issues at a young age make me think things need to change.","Definitely.  Hopefully the steps will begin when children begin playing football at a young age.

There are so many story lines to follow with players changing teams and exciting rookies coming into the league.","I agree, but I think Ezekiel Elliot is going to tear it up in his second year.  I saw him in the ESPN Body Issue and he looks ripped and ready to punish some defenses!  I can't wait!","What player changing teams are you most excited to see?

Marshawn Lynch to the Raiders, AP to the Saints, Jamaal Charles to the Broncos, and Alshon Jeffrey to the Eagles are the ones I'm most excited to see!","I'm excited to see how Lynch does after his brief retirement.

Remember his run in the Super Bowl a few years ago?  Simply amazing!","Oh man definitely Beast Mode at his finest.  I think the league missed having a character around like him.  I'm excited to see how he does with the Raiders.  What other story lines are you following?","I'm interested to see if Colin Kaepernick or Jay Cutler end up signing somewhere or not.  All it will take is a major injury for a star quarterback and maybe one of them will be back.

That franchise hasn't been good since it started during the mid-1990s.","I acknowledge that it's been terrible for the past decade, but they just fired Gus Bradley and have made a lot of big name acquisitions in free agency.","The Gus Bradley firing was well overdue. However, Doug Marrone seems like a terrible head coach replacement given his mediocre record as the head coach for the Buffalo Bills.","Jacksonville has built a great defense and just needs to get its act together on offense. I believe that Marrone's offensive mind coupled with first round draft pick Leonard Fournette will result in the team's improvement.","I think that you're being sanguine regarding Jacksonville for the 2017 NFL season. I would contend that the Indianapolis Colts are better positioned to do well this year.","While Andrew Luck is a very talented quarterback, he is way too banged up to lead the Colts to success this year.","You're forgetting the fact that just two years ago, they were in the AFC Championship game.","The key part of that phrase is ""two years ago."" They have a terrible offensive line and defense, which makes it way too difficult for Luck to unilaterally carry the team.","I think that between their weapons on offensive like Hilton and their decent head coach, they have a shot to contend for the AFC South.","They are probably the weakest division in the NFL currently. The funny thing is that if one team were able to get their act together, they could easily dominate the division like the Patriots dominate the NFC East.","I just think that apart from Luck, the rest of that team is a mess. Their owner is erratic and creates a culture of chaos for that team.","Totally agree with that assessment. If the Texans were just able to fix their quarterback situation, I think that they'd not only win the AFC South for years, but that they would also become a legitimate Super Bowl contender.","What's crazy about Houston is that Bill O'Brien was hired because he's this supposed offensive genius and he's already gone through several different quarterbacks in his short time there.","Yeah, I can understand failing with Ryan Mallett and Brian Hoyer, but he should have been able to succeed with Brock Osweiler.","I disagree with you on that point. Brock Osweiler was inconsistent and was prone to throw interceptions.","True, but this is also the guy who briefly took over for Peyton Manning during the Denver Bronco's 2015 Super Bowl Season and defeated Tom Brady's Patriots, which clinched the team home field advantage throughout the playoffs.","Agree to disagree on that point. However, if Bill O'Brien is able to properly develop Deshaun Watson, Houston will have an amazing offense for years to come.","I really liked Watson when he was at Clemson and am rooting for him in the NFL.

Johnny Manziel? Who was pretty exciting to watch until his life careened into substance abuse problems and domestic violence allegations. Totally different QB than Goff is though.","You could make an argument that Case Keenum might be the best Air Raid QB in the NFL right now, honestly","And yeah, Jared Goff's hand size probably played a role in him fumbling the ball 23 times at Cal, but he did manage to cut that number down to 4 in his last season.","I think the hand size thing is probably less of an issue given that he'll be playing in Los Angeles rather than Cleveland.","I will say that I think the hand-size argument is a little overblown. Tony Romo has similarly small hands, too.","Case Keenum might be! And he honestly could open the season as the starter too. I don't think it'd shock anyone if the Rams waited a few weeks to throw in Goff.","I don't see a world where they wait on Jared Goff past Week 1.","This is true. Case Keenum isn't the one making an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel later this week.","If you're asking what WILL the Rams do with the No. 1 pick, I think it's going to be stunning if they pick anyone other than Jared Goff at this point. Vegas has him as an incredible 1-to-15 favorite, and it makes sense from a whole lot of other angles as well.","That's great a discussion. Something tells me we, and Rams fans everywhere, will be talking about this draft for a long time.","As for what SHOULD they do? I think one can still make a strong argument for Carson Wentz, though I'm inclined to lean toward Goff in this phrasing too.","Well, if the Rams followed my advice, they wouldn't have traded for the top pick in the first place. They've clearly settled on Jared Goff, and he's definitely the more NFL-ready of the top-two quarterbacks. I still think Carson Wentz might have a higher ceiling. But in terms of winning right now, which the Rams have to do, Goff is the guy","Jack, what will fans like about Jared Goff?","I think he's the kind of guy that's not going to get shaken easily. It's not going to get much worse for him than what happened at Cal when he was a freshman, what with going 1-11 and all.","He definitely has a presence in the pocket that's unlike any other quarterback in this class. In fact, his pocket presence might be better than any QB in the last few drafts.","I talked to him last summer about that 2013 season, and what struck me was when he said that -- as bad as that season went -- he always believed he was the best player on the field. He said this while recognizing that it wasn't always true objectively, but stressed that that kind of self-confidence was important to his success.","Goff is used to playing with 4 WR's in a spread system. He might not have four WR's that belong on an NFL roster with the Rams offense, let alone on the field at one time.","",""

What matters more is Pro Bowl selections and Flacco has none.","That's a totally legitimate criticism of Flacco, but I'm talking about his potential for this season.","Let's put that issue aside for now. You still haven't addressed either Antonio Brown or Le'Veon Bell.","Le'Veon Bell is good when healthy but his physical playing style leaves him too susceptible to injury. My concerns with Antonio Brown tend to deal more with his off field maturity.","Are you referring to the locker room Facebook video incident following the Kansas City playoff game?","Yeah. Not only does it show that he doesn't take his job seriously, but it sheds light on Mike Tomlin's inability to keep his players disciplined.","While that situation was not ideal, I think it was overblown by the media. Furthermore, I don't understand your criticism of Mike Tomlin.","Tomlin is an overrated coach who inherited a Super Bowl winning team from Bill Cowher. He is very unprofessional and was caught on a nationally televised game attempting to interfere with a kickoff return.","I disagree entirely with that statement. Tomlin has been head coach for ten seasons now and the team has had seven playoff appearances during his tenure.","Can you address the kick off interference incident during the Thanksgiving game?","I'd that the Steelers are a lot better. Frankly, it's not even close.","It was an honest mistake and the NFL did not find that it warranted giving up draft picks, which sort of clears him. However, I'll acknowledge that he did have to pay a hefty fine for it.","Really? I agree that the Steelers are probably better, but it's not by a significant margin.","The Steelers have the best wide receiver in the NFL in Antonio Brown, the best running back in the NFL in Le'Veon Bell, and Ben Roethlisberger, who is a future hall of famer.","Regarding Ben Roethlisberger, the man is 35 and is beginning to think about retirement. He probably has three seasons left in him, maximum.","Who would you rather have as your quarterback then, Ben Roethlisberger or Joe Flacco?","To be honest, Flacco. He's much healthier and a much better quarterback in January.","Really? Flacco has only one Super Bowl appearance while Roethlisberger has three.","Yeah, but Roethlisberger has no Super Bowl MVPs and Flacco has one.","",""

The article said he might play a couple more seasons at USC.","He's going to wait for the 2019 season?","He still has time to decide, but several people close to him have said he might want to play with USC a couple more seasons.","",""

As it’s week 1 and fresh off a Superbowl victory, Seattle, which is historically tough at home, will be extra raucous. That’s also taken into account when setting the line.","Do you expect lines to move a lot more early in the season until more info on teams comes in?","Absolutely. We need time like anyone else to figure out which surprises are legit. That means the lines aren’t as stable as they would be later in the season. Same is true of any sport.","Do you think that provides more value for bettors or more concerns?","it can be more value for those that take the time to evaluate and analyze, but it can also be concerning for those taking shots in the dark or making assumptions","How much does a team’s popularity factor into markets? Enough to move handicaps?","That’s tricky. Teams in high-population markets with good teams can move the markets, but our clientele is sharper than the average sportsbook’s, so our lines won’t move as much in that way.","Which teams get the biggest bumps that way?","It’s what you’d expect. Teams that make the Superbowl, that have national brands, that are fun to watch. It depends on he spread though…if you have the Broncos as a 14-point favourite, our clientele know there may be value on the dog because of the inflated line.","How does stronger enforcement of pass interference/illegal contact impact week 1 lines?","Yeah but it can be tricky.","That’s a good question…hadn’t really considered it. I don’t think it affects the spread much because it’s a two-way game, but you may see an increase in the total points scored per game. We’ll watch that through the season and see if it has an effect, and whether it’s called as much as in pre-season.","How can I use the weather information to make better totals bets?","By getting early information. You’ll see adjustments to our lines once information comes out, but you still need to be careful; lousy weather doesn’t always = under. We’ve been burned by that misconception more than a few times","On analysis, is it better to put less weight on the passing & put more on rushing & defensive discipline?","Interesting question. I believe you need to incorporate both…it’s still a passing league and teams are shifting away from run-heavy offenses. Need to put equal weight on all phases of the game and find the strength of each team","Will there be fixed wagering limits on NFL in-play markets?","We have limits on live betting and will adhere to them at a minimum. However, we may at certain times increase limits for marquee games or as we see fit for certain games.","With the Seahawks record at (home field) CenturyLink, how does HFA factor into lines compared to the rest of the league?","",""

I would be more concerned about their defense if I were you.","Based on their 13-3 record last season, I think that they have the best odds of making the Super Bowl of any team in the NFC.","Between Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott, and Dez Bryant, they can easily score enough points per game to overcome any defensive issues.","Seriously? Have you seen their playoff record over the past 20 years?","Playoff games are always funny things and they should have won that 2015 game in Green Bay. Moreover, this is a much more experienced team than last year.","This season will only be Dak Prescott's second season.

Ben Roethlisberger and Russell Wilson both won Super Bowls during their sophomore seasons.","Yeah, but more often than not, opposing teams learn how to better plan for quarterbacks after their rookie seasons, which leads to regression.","While this may be the case, Dallas's offensive advantage largely stems not from the quarterback position, but from their running game and their amazing offensive line.","I can't argue with you on their offensive line. However, their leading rusher is still under investigation from the NFL and could be suspended for part of next year.","",""

I know a lot of people agree with you - probably in St. Louis, San Diego and Oakland.","There are particularly two incidents from the whole St. Louis to L.A. move that still bother me.","Yeah, like what?","Well, first is the owners vote. Originally, there weren't enough owners voting to move the group. Then, when they took a ""blind"" vote where owners didn't have accountability to their vote, they voted to move the team.","In other words, if the owners didn't have to be wedded publicly to their vote, then they voted for the money.","Precisely. Then, St. Louis also met every guideline presented by the NFL. According to Dave Peacock, the guy spearheading the Rams in St. Louis movement, the NFL were very, um, shady in their dealings.","Well, look, from the perspective outside St. Louis, the headline was ""Rams back to L.A."" not ""St. Louis gets screwed"".","No, not really actually?","Very true.

I suppose if you have an allegiance to a city that no longer has a team you might feel cheated.","Yeah, I sure do. I've analyzed what went down with the decision to move the NFL from St. Louis to L.A. and from every angle I think the city got screwed.","Don't you think San Diego and Oakland feel the same way?","They may feel the same way, but the fact remains, particularly in the case of Oakland, the city offered no public money.

He's one of the best physical wide receivers in the league and helps open up the running game for Dallas.","While that might be true, he is a terrible route runner that has too much trouble getting seperation from defenders.","That's not ideal, but he is still able to catch the ball in spite of double coverage on key plays.","I think his record is mixed on that front. Furthermore, I feel that his inability to control his emotions causes him to be a distraction, which hurts his team.","You say emotional, I say passionate. You probably wouldn't put Odell Beckham Jr. in your top five I guess.","I would in terms of talent. However, I would put him in the fourth or fifth position.","Really? His speed and catching range are not just the best in the NFL right now, but potentially all time great.","I agree that he is among the best receivers, if not the best receiver, in terms of talent. However, he's too temperamental, especially in his match ups against Josh Norman.","I believe that in his last match up against Josh Norman, Norman was the one with all the penalties and getting overly emotional.","True, but this is following too match ups where Norman obviously got the better of Beckham Jr. Furthermore, the boat trip before the Green Bay playoff game last year demonstrated poor decision making on his part and hurt his team.","I would say Antonio Brown would be the top receiver, followed by Odell Beckham Jr., Julio Jones, Dez Bryant, and Rob Gronkowski.","The criticism surrounding that boat trip is ridiculous. The trip was during the Giants day off and Odell Beckham Jr. did not miss any of the required practices that week.","Does Rob Gronkowski count? He's a tight end.","You just said receiver. You didn't specify that they had to be a wide receiver.","Fair enough. While Rob Gronkowski is a great player and a lock to make the Hall of Fame after he retires, he's too injury prone for me to put in my top five.","That's a fair criticism. However, he's Tom Brady's best offensive weapon by far and his size and speed can't be matched by any defender.","True, but he was injured for the second half of last season and the Patriots were still able to win the Super Bowl without him.","I think that had more to do with the football genius of Bill Belichick coupled with Tom Brady's excellence at quarterback.","That's an entirely different subject for debate. Back to the original question though, do you really think that Dez Bryant is currently a top five receiver?","",""

Last season, Earl Thomas broke his tibia before the playoffs and they apparently didn't even report Richard Sherman's sprained MCL.","Football players are always playing through injury. I'm sure that there are a lot of banged up players that we don't know about in the NFL.","When you couple the injuries with their increasing ages and their large contracts, I don't see how Seattle can continue to compete moving forward.","Seattle still has one of the best front offices with John Schneider as GM. This is the guy who picked Russell Wilson, Richard Sherman, and Kam Chancellor in the later rounds of the draft after all.","True, but I haven't seen any great late round draft picks from Seattle in the last two seasons. Moreover, I keep reading reports of tensions between the players in the Seattle locker room.","Are you referring to the alleged Richard Sherman-Russell Wilson feud?","I'm more so referring to how Pete Carroll takes such a hands off attitude in controlling players that it ultimately manifests in a lack of discipline. Richard Sherman should not have been able to yell at a coach last season regarding an offensive play call.","I feel that Pete Carroll's light touch approach allows the players to relax and play better. Also, Richard Sherman was right about that offensive call.","Whether he was right or wrong is an entirely different subject. My argument is that you can't run a team where everyone is trying to lead.","Until that light touch approach begins to manifest itself on the football field, I won't criticize Pete Carroll for it. I saw an interview with Michael Bennett the other week and he said that Carroll's light touch approach was useful in attracting free agents to the team.","That team is past its prime and will likely relinquish their grip on the NFC West within the next three years.","Maybe that's true, but I would say that Seattle's recent success coupled with Washington's lack of an income tax play bigger factors in attracting free agents.","Seattle has a great quarterback and dominant defense. What more could you want?","Russell Wilson is an undersized game manager.","That's unfair! He's probably one of the most accurate and mature quarterbacks in the NFL right now.","From everything I hear, he's a great guy. However, if you put him on a bad team, he probably couldn't make them win.","Now we're getting into hypothetical territory. You still haven't addressed their defense.","The Seahawks defense was all-time great two or three years ago. Now they're just old and overpaid.","Harsh! You don't think that the Legion of Boom is still one of the top defensive secondaries in the league?","",""

Yes sometimes they can be hard to grade, like will Bill Belichick smile on camera in the Super Bowl, but this type of prop betting really started I would say about 10 years ago once online gaming became more and more popular.","Super Bowl prop bets really started to get popular mid-1990s thanks in large part to Imperial Palace in Las Vegas. Many of those guys that made those prop bets are now at Westgate Sportsbook. The guys at Imperial palace not only offered quality Super Bowl props, they offered a high quantity of props as well. It’s one of those things where if you have the creative insight, the sky's the limit as far as Super Bowl props you can offer.","What is your favorite proposition bet of all time?","I have done so many, but one that always stands out was after the Tebow era where every week we had props on him was ""What will he do first? Throw another TD Pass in the NFL or admit to having Sexual Intercourse."" Yes maybe a bit offside but I still laugh at that one when I see it in our system since we are still waiting to grade it!”","I like the national anthem over/under time in seconds prop. Since you get new performers every year, the over/under number is always different. We usually scour the internet, going to YouTube, and such to try and find past performances of the artist performing the national anthem.","This year we have Time It Takes Idina Menzel To Sing National Anthem as 122.5 seconds. We opened it 121.5 seconds and 88% of the early money was on the over, so we moved it up another second. This is always one of the most popular props with the betting public. It is a prop you can get many people to bet, people who don’t normally bet on the NFL.","My favorite, and we still do it, is the average number of all the jerseys to score a touchdown.","I think that’s my favorite because it takes a little bit of thinking. You have to figure out who may score, if #85 scores and #12 scores twice, so that’s one of my favorites. That’s ours, we have a lot of our own individual props, and I’m sure everybody has their own. But there’s some that we have originated here that we continue to stay with.","How often do you bet on the NFL?","I like to bet every game.","If you include all the props and futures (odds to win Super Bowl included) that we offer on it, the Super Bowl makes up 7 percent of our total betting volume for the year.","Me too.","The way to look at it is, the whole state (of Nevada) does about roughly $3.5 billion (for sports betting), and this game does somewhere around $100 million. Last year, it was $120 (million). So that right there will tell you how much of the whole year this game is, 3 percent really is what it is.","The NFL is about 20% of our whole year in sports betting and the Super Bowl is 5-10% of the total money we take on the NFL. So roughly 2 per cent.”","Most people think of betting the game and lines, but what value do proposition bets bring to this event? Does it bring the once-a-year type of bettor (marginal) into the equation? Do prop bets get more action than traditional bets?","Prop bets are something we take pride in; we offer prop bets throughout the whole year in every sport, entertainment, politics and business, but there is no question that the Super Bowl prop bets started the popularity of this type of wagering.  About 30% of our new clients that sign up leading up to Super Bowl their first bet ever is on some sort of prop so that shows the significance props play in our business.","I think there are definitely some value plays when it comes to Super Bowl props bets. Just look at the coin toss, only have to lay 3 cents juice on this prop. Typically have to lay 10 cents juice on a NFL game line. Prop bets make just under 30 percent of our total Super Bowl betting handle.","When you first put them up, it’s 100 percent sharps betting them. That’s what they’re doing, they’re just waiting for you to put them up, trying to find the weak spots, trying to put one place against another. They’re trying to arbitrage the props, that’s all it is. After that, it’s basically all the guests coming to town that bet them. So what happens is the sharps hit them first and then the guys coming to town get the second shot at them. That’s kind of the way it is. I’d say the sharps are only about maybe 15 percent of the action.","I heard that prop bets exploded with the ""Will Refrigerator Perry score a touchdown"" bet. Any idea on when the ""entertaining"" bets came into being, i.e., length of the national anthem, wardrobe changes, first commercial, etc.?","",""

There is no way he is better than Eli Manning.","Eli Manning has led the league in interceptions on numerous occasions. Although he's a two-time Super Bowl MVP, both were very fluky.","It's hard to consider his Super Bowl wins flukes when he did it against Tom Brady, arguably the greatest quarterback ever, both times.","I have no problem referring to his wins as flukes. He won his first Super Bowl off a crazy helmet catch from David Tyree and won the second Super Bowl because Wes Welker dropped a pass.","Regardless, Eli Manning has provided stability to the Giants since he was drafted and has an unmatched ability to remain calm under pressure.","I just think that the Giant's recent success has more to do with Odell Beckham Jr. and their defense than it has to do with Manning.","Odell Beckham Jr. is another overly emotional wide receiver that is a distraction to his team.","That argument is so old at this point that it's not even worth going into. He filled the void that Victor Cruz left following his series of injuries.","I would have to say the NFC East. Did you know that no team has finished first in the NFC East in consecutive years since the Eagles in 2004.","I just think that it will be hard for the Giants to reach another Super Bowl if Odell Beckham Jr. does not take things more seriously.","That's really interesting. I just think that the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Giants are far superior to the Philadelphia Eagles and the Washington Redskins.","While I think that the Eagles are probably the worst NFC East team going into the season, they have a great young quarterback and could be competitive. Everyone forgets that they started last season with a 4-0 record.","True, but both the Redskins and the Eagles lack organizational strengths of the Giants and Cowboys.","Are you seriously contending that the Jerry Jones-owned and operated Cowboys exhibit organizational strength?","Jerry Jones gets a bad reputation because of his crazy actions as GM during the late 1990s and 2000s. However, his focus on drafting a strong offensive line demonstrates how he has begun to mature as a GM.","The Dallas Cowboys is an organization that allows Dez Bryant to be late to or miss numerous meetings per year. How is that a strong organization?","I acknowledge that Dez being late to meetings was a major issue in the past, but they're working to solve it. However, it is undeniable that in recent years, they have drafted the best offensive line, the best running back, and the best young quarterback in football.","",""

There have been numerous reports from his teammates that he can be difficult to work with, which can be detrimental to the team.","All great quarterbacks can be difficult to work with. If you go on YouTube, you can easily find videos of Tom Brady and Peyton Manning getting into arguments with their coaches and teammates.","Yeah, but I don't think that there exists the same level of resentment from those people towards Manning and Brady as there exists towards Aaron Rodgers.","Let's agree to disagree. So I guess based on your previous comments that you think that Brady is the best quarterback in the NFL right now.","I think that he's the best quarterback not just currently, but of all time. However, if I were to start a team right now, I would pick Andrew Luck just based on age.","Why Andrew Luck? He's been banged up so much the last few seasons that the damage might be irreversible.","He still possess the size, strength, and smarts to be an elite quarterback.","I would say Aaron Rodgers.","I just find him overrated. Ever since making the AFC Championship Game in 2015, he hasn't been able to return to the playoffs.","Not Tom Brady?","Tom Brady just plays for the best team in the league. I think that a sizable portion of his success is attributable to having Bill Belichick as his coach and general manager.","You're not giving Brady enough credit. You don't win five Super Bowls without having immense talent.","I'm not saying that he's not talented, but his first three Super Bowls had more to do with a dominant defense than Brady's play at quarterback.","All I know is that last season, Brady led the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history against the Atlanta Falcons while Aaron Rodgers collapsed against them in the NFC Championship Game.","That is true, but incomplete. Let us not forget that Aaron Rodgers had just completed an improbable eight-game winning streak and had lost his leading receiver Jordy Nelson to injury two games prior.","How does losing one player two games back explain his 44-21 drubbing during the NFC Championship game? Let us also not forget that the Packers were down 24-0 at halftime of that game.","",""

They only have two good quarterbacks, and Phillip Rivers is in the twilight of his career.","That might be true right now, but both Kansas City and Denver have competent quarterbacks that could return them to the playoffs.","I don't think that either Trevor Siemian or Paxton Lynch are ready to take Denver back to the Super Bowl. Regarding Kansas City, do you think rookie Patrick Mahomes will be great this season?","Mahomes has raw talent and can likely develop behind Alex Smith.","Yeah, but Alex Smith is not great. He totally botched that playoff game last year against the Steelers.","No one would call Smith elite, but he's a decent enough game manager that could shepherd them to the playoffs. Once they get into the playoffs, you never know what will happen.","I just think that Kansas City lacks what it takes to close the deal and win a Super Bowl at this point.","",""
