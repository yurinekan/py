They're so good.","They were one of the first hip-hop groups I could put my dad onto.","Why's that?","They're conscious rap and they sample Lou Reed and have a jazzy feel. That's all up my dad's alley.","Well, did he like it?","Like it? He loved it.","That's really heartening.","I read some blogs like Stereogum and Pigeons and Planes and I check Pitchfork.","Yeah, it completely changed his attitudes towards rap.","I know Stereogum and Pitchfork, what's that other one? Pigeons and Planes?","It's a hip hop blog that also focuses on indie rock.","Oh, sounds right up my alley. I'm gonna make a note about that right now.","Yeah, you should do that for sure. How do you find music?","I really like podcasts for finding music, actually. My favorite podcasts are All Songs Considered and Sound Opinions.","I really love Sound Opinions. They do such deep dives on my favorite artists and even things like guitar solos.","Yeah, I find with both shows that the passion of the hosts for music is contagious and that I find myself having a much more vociferous appetite for music following listening to them.","x",""

The heavy use of keyboards was very 80's but it's still a wonderful atmospheric album.","I especially like Simon Gallup's bass parts on that album.

I like seeing how far we've come as a society and a human race, and where we are now, and how the similarities are still present in the music, how lessons can be learned, that kind of thing.","That's pretty observant. YouTube and the Internet Archive have a lot of old wax cylinders, discs, and 78 shellac discs digitized for online listening and download.","They really do, it's great to see so much music in the public-domain is able to be preserved and retained for posterity. I like physical media because some day, the Internet might not be widely or conveniently available.","Agreed, and it's wise to have a backup plan. The nice thing about CDs is that so long as the player operates and we have batteries, we don't need computers or even electricity to power them!","Right-o! Old phonograph media is even better, because so long as it is preserved well, it will continue to play well so long as we have a sort of needle, sound diaphragm and audio horn.","Music for the global Apocalypse. Music to stand the test of time.","Exactly right. I try to hoard all the music that I can, and the same with books and media.","Me too. Digital copies are great for convenience and keeping the physical goods safely tucked away.","Mhm, and some artists are saving costs and only releasing themselves via digital downloads. Kind of sucks having to burn your own CDs, because you never know if they'll hold up or degrade with time, versus factory-pressed discs.","I agree wholeheartedly, so I rip everything to my portable hard drive and play it from there, to keep the media from oxygenating and getting spoiled - I can ensure 1-to-1 lossless bitrate in the audio, too, which some stores don't provide, as not all of them sell FLAC for Windows, or AAC for the Mac OS.","I can appreciate the music being made conveniently-available at less cost, but I much prefer having a physical record to hold onto, regardless of format.","Me, too! It's up to we in the present to maintain the past generational experiences for the betterment of the future in terms of learning where we've been and where we're going as a human society.","I agree! There are plenty of good reissue labels available that do just that. Bear Family Records out of Germany reissues some great blues, rock, country, and European music in deluxe CD box sets for avid collectors.","I like them, too. It's nice having complete discographies of people like George Jones and Merle Haggard, although they are pricey at around eighty to a hundred-plus dollars apiece per set.","Yeah, but some labels are cheaper and just as good. Document Records is a nice Euro label covering American roots music, heavy on the Black genres of blues and rock, and also good for old-time rural music from White America.","I have almost everything from the hillbilly series myself. I also like Archeophone Records, based out of Illinois in the States.","What do they have to offer? Do they do vinyl or CDs?","They primarily focus on compact disc of old phonograph artists from the birth of the recording industry, the late 1800s to about 1925, just before electricity was used in the recording process.","That's pretty obscure, buddy. How does somebody get into listening to that kind of thing?","x",""

Anyway, punk was born as a specific response to progressive music, which didn't appeal to youth much as the 70s got closer to the 80s.","What changed? I thought progressive rock was a bunch of stoner druggies.","Well, the kids started to realize that the previous generation failed. They got angry and some of the drugs didn't appeal anymore.","Like pot isn't as nice when you are angry.","Correct. So in this angry response, the kids were really trying to get the same things as the hippies - think of Anarchy in UK. Think of what they are asking for.","It is about getting rid of the establishment and creating a new society.","Exactly, and those concepts were explored a lot by the hippie movement, like Jefferson Airplane.","But what about the goths?","Yes, so the goths really completed the cycle, they looked at these failed political pushes and finally internalized the needs for change by introducing themselves into the mix. Not egotistically, but realisitically. The post-punk / goth movement is incredibly political and social, and yet it strikes the heart of the issue - the self.","That's a weird theory, what makes you say such a thing?","That's a good explanation - and there are other connections too. Like The Mission was produced by John Paul Jones! Thank you for the summary!","Well, the hippie movement was a political and social reaction to a lot that was going on at the time. Particularly Vietnam, Woman's Rights, and other political movements of significance.","Yes, but goth music is just about sad people moping around.","Not really, but that is part of it. However, it also makes sense when you realize that the hippie movement failed to fulfill many of its dreams.","Not really, a lot of what they wanted actually came true.","You might think that, but consider that the movement was all but dead when Vietnam finally stopped, consider that woman's rights is still an issue (equal pay, for instance). Consider that racial rights is very much still up for discussion.","So, how did this change happen?","Well part of it is understanding some history of music. The Hippie movement was based from folk and combined with rock. In Europe, there was a similar movement, but instead of combining folk, it was classical.","x",""
