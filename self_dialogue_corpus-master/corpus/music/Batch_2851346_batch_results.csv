They're another one of my favorites.","Seems like you've got some eclectic tastes when it comes to music. Who else are you into?","Well don't call me an Indie snob, but I also like Neutral Milk Hotel, Tegan and Sera, and Death Cab For Cutie.","I won't call you an Indie snob. Most of those artists have gone mainstream by now anyway.","That's true. I don't know what Death Cab is considered these days. I guess still the Indie genre?","I suppose I would say so. A lot of people would say they've sold out.","I never say an artist has sold out unless they totally change their style to something that panders, which they have not done at all. Ben Gibbard is a genius.","Oh yeah, I really like that song. Adele is a pretty great artist.","You've got that right! Now we've really got something we can agree on.","She has a very strong voice. What's your overall favorite genre?","I'd say I'm honestly less of a pop fan and more of an alternative rock fan.","Really? Tell me a few of your favorite artists and I'll tell you mine.","Well I'm a big fan of the red hot chili peppers, Popevil, Three Doors Down, and Breaking Benjamin.","That's quite a list you've got there! Mine are Peter Bjorn and Jon, The Lumineers, and Mumford and Sons.","Seems like we have quite different tastes in music. Do you like The Killers?","Oh I love them! You know I saw them at the Music Midtown Festival a few months back.","x",""

There are so many venders, and so many different things to try.","You're welcome, and don't worry- July seventh, we're going to rock!","Well, Taste Of Chicago is about food of course, but they also have bands playing every day so you have something to do while you're sitting down eating all the food items you bought.","Oh sure, I like going to watch the bands. I usually get three or four plates from different venders and grab a beverage and eat while I watch a band.","They usually have seven to ten bands a day playing, and July seventh there's a band I want to see- Ben Harper and the Criminals.","Oh, I remember Ben Harper. He was really popular about fifteen years ago.","Ben Harper is a fabulous guitar player. He's a terrific singer, and his live shows are always amazing.","He plays such a wide variety of genres, it keeps it from being boring. He can switch back and forth from a blues song to a rock song to a reggae song, and it all seems to blend together perfectly.","That's why I was asking if you were going to the Taste, I want to go on the seventh and see Ben Harper, but I need a ride because my husband's going to be out of town with our car.","x",""

I know your impression of pop is probably not the best, but I urge you to give it a try. You might be surprised--her music is actually very thought out despite often being danceable.","I've added it to my wishlist... The way you talk about it makes it seem a bit more interesting, thanks.","Thank you! Also, I started listening to some Steve Roach on YouTube. I know ambient is supposed to be instrumental and slow, but is there supposed to be more than this throughout? I guess I was expecting more of a melody.","It's true that kind of music isn't really melody-centric, but that's part of why it can be so interesting and evocative. We're so used to the idea of melody that we don't get to appreciate harmonies as much.","Hey, I've always loved harmony too, and this definitely has that. I'm just not sure I get it...","Don't worry about it. It could be the kind of thing you find yourself enjoying if you just leave it on in the background. It's very ""vertical"" music, as opposed to horizontal, where it's focused on layers even when there's not a lot of change over time. It's supposed to have a hypnotic effect over you.","Yeah, I'll finish giving it a shot. This song is like an hour long though, it's kind of crazy. I'm also looking forward to hearing your feedback about Goldfrapp!","Heh, yep they're often pretty long. I think those kinds of ambient are called drone. Sustained tones and all that. I'll get back to you when I finish listening to Goldfrapp.","Sure, no problem. I appreciate finding someone who's open to exploring outside their comfort zone. I'm trying to do the same, haha.","That depends on what moods you're looking for, I guess. Ambient is such a varied genre.","Me, too. Even though I've been listening to sad music all this time, I'm not opposed to trying to understand things that I used to reject. Thanks for that.","Things have been rough for the past week or two over here, heh. So, I don't know, something cathartic?","Then I'd definitely suggest something sadder, or darker. Two artists you might want to check out are Steve Roach and Tim Hecker.","Great, thanks. I'm not sure how keen I am about the idea of ""dark"" music; I'm so used to music being uplifting and cheerful.","Wish I could say I understand that! I've always been a little put off by it.","What makes you say that? Doesn't everyone like to feel the energy from a beat?","Nah, not with me anyway. I haven't found something that sounds blatantly ""happy"" yet doesn't come across as extremely cheesy.","Well if it's okay with you, I'd like to return your recommendation with one of my own. Listen to Goldfrapp!","x",""

I think my favorite new Katy song is Chained To The Rhythm. It's so smooth, takes me to another place.","It reminds me of the the Jessie J, Price Tag song.","You're right, it does use a bit of the same beat.","I like Chained To The Rhythm too, but Bon Appetite is my favorite current Katy song.","Is that your favorite Katy song of all time?","x",""

I might even become an actually Green Day fan after this, instead of just an ambivalent tag-along.","I should hope so. And, just so you don't embarrass yourself at the show, know that they're more than just ""grunge"" - their music covers a lot of genres, from punk rock to rock opera.","You mean that grunge band from the 1990s?","Noted. I shall heretofore refrain from pigeon-holing Green Day and its lead bard Billie Joe Armstrong. Now, let's get our hands on those tickets for the show!","Yes, basically. They're still touring and just put out a new album, Revolution Radio, in 2016. But, yes, that's the Green Day I mean, the grunge band that got big in the 1990s.","I see. In that case, I suppose my feelings about Green Day are ambivalent at best. Why do you ask?","Well, I'm a huge fan - like, a serious, lifelong, die-hard fan - and I just heard they'll be playing a secret show downtown next week, so I'm going to try to get tickets.","Wow, I had no idea you were such a grunge-rock girl!","You better believe it! Green Day was the first band I ever saw live in concert, back in 1995 when they were touring ""Dookie.""","Oh yeah, I think I remember that album - that song ""When I Come Around"" was all over the radio, if I recall.","Right! I mean come on, everyone one was a Green Day fan in 1995.","x",""

What if you tried playing Beethoven or mozart for her, do you think she would enjoy that?","Dude, she would probably run home, log into facebook, and announce how much of a loser I am to all of her hot friends.","But Beethoven and Mozart are so talented, they composed symphonies that have shaped so many minds and influenced individuals to pursue their dreams.","Thats great and all, but I think women like music that makes them feel wild and ready to party. I do not think Beethoven and Mozart are going to make any one want to have a little fun tonight","Perhaps you are right, when I listen to Beethoven and Mozart I end up studying astrophysics, math, chemistry, and x-ray crystallography","Thats so sad, next time you should put on some Drake or Nicki Minaj and go try and pick up a girl.","Hey Manoj, No I am not into hip hop music. Why you listen to drake?","Sometimes my cat sits in my lap and listens to moonlight sonata with me, that is all the companionship I can handle at this point, my mom doesn't want me to have a girl friend","Yeah he is fantastic, he wrote a bunch of hits recently, and the ladies love his music. Why don't you like hip-hop?","Hip hop makes my head hurt from all of the loud bass that comes out of the speakers?","Really, I did not know you don't like bass. What type of music do you listen to then?","I love classical music, like Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach. Have you ever listened to classical music?","I listened to classical music when I was in high school, but everyone thought I was a nerd and I never had any girls trying to hang out with me.","So the only reason you listen to Drake and hip-hop is because you want women to like you?","No that is not entirely true, I like hip hop because of the complex rhyme structure, the creative use of metaphors, and I of course love the bass, especially when I am driving, I like to blast the bass music","x",""
