I actually don't know anyone who's familiar with Ska who doesn't love it.","Well that sounds promising!","Yeah! There's even a dance people do to it that's called ""skanking"".","I'm all about that.","Mainly ska, hip hop and melodic folk metal.","Great! I could use someone to skank with.","Ska?","Yep.","I don't know what that is.","Oh, well it's a fun style of music that typically has a walking baseline, and horns, and there are similar themes in the lyrics.","Is it like Jazz?","No, although I've heard some artists incorporate jazz styles into some of their songs.","Hmm, sounds interesting.","x",""

They all loved entertainment, especially music.","And a chamber group was the equivalent of having your own karaoke band in your own home!","Can you imagine what it must have been like, having Joseph Haydn or Vivaldi, or even Mozart visit your house?","Who? Is that a classical composer?","Mozart did chamber music? Oh, yeah, I saw that in the movie, ""Amadeus""!","Yes, Vivaldi was classical, but his work is really described as ""chamber music"".","What's chamber music? Music played in a chamber?","Well, yes. it refers to a very small group of musicians. Vivaldi preferred a violin or two, a viola, and a cello.","So what tunes have I heard? I seem to remember some pieces that I think I saw Itzak Perlman and Pinchas Zuckerman playing.","I remember that - they played The Four Seasons on PBS, and that was really amazing.","but - tell me why so few instruments are involved. What is chamber music, really?","Oh, Antonio Vivaldi really championed it. Rather than having such a huge orchestra, a chamber group can play in a very intimate setting, where people can get much closer to the musicians.","x",""
