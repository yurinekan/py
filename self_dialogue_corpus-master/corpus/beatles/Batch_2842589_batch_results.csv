The Beatles moved pop/rock music away from that lighter 'bubble gum' sound, and went back to its roots.

If you play any instrument, you should look for transcriptions of Beatles songs and play along.  Even the simple songs use unexpected chord structures that, although they sound simple, give the music added sonic depth.","What songs would you suggest I listen to?","With the Beatles, you're better off listening to full albums.  They were putting out music at a time when a great deal of care went into crafting an album in a way that the songs built one on the other to make something greater than the individual parts.  Try the albums 'Revolver' or 'Rubber Soul'.","x",""

Of course why would he complain? He made so much money as a member of the group, and he never had to feel the pressure of doing a lot of writing.  Yes, rest in peace George.","I think he was very underrated to the group.  he was obviously not utilized to his fullest.","Could you provide some specifics about why you feel like that? I'm interested, because he really showed his talents, mostly, after the group broke up.","Exactly.  once the group broke up, Harrison really came into his own.  His concert for Bangla Desh, at Madison Square Garden, was one for the ages.","Very true.  Now i'm not suggesting the Beatles totally forgot about his abilities.  Consider the ""Abbey Road"" album; Harrison had two standouts on that one.","Yes.  more than on any other Beatles album, Harrison really came through on that one.  ""Here Comes the Sun"" is outstanding, and ""Something"" became a standard which many other artists, even Frank Sinatra, did versions of.","After the group broke up, Harrison released his ""All Things Must Pass"" album which almost forced people, who had previously overlooked him, to notice him.","For sure.  with that album, which was either the first or second solo album of ANY of the Beatles, Harrison was established as a mega-talent.   I'm sure it was at that point that many people felt the Beatles had not used him as they should have.","In a way i agree with that, but again, we have to keep in mind that basically it was Lennon and McCartney's group.  They had almost always given George one cut an album; no more, and no less (with the exception of ""Abbey Road,"" as we mentioned).  It was obviously Harrison's role to be a great guitarist, sing background vocals, and leave the ""heavy lifting"" to Paul and John.","x",""
