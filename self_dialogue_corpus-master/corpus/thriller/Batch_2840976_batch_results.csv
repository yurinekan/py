Are you upset that there wasn't a plot twist at the end?","Well I guess, yeah I am. I was getting really into the lives of the two detectives, especially Brad Pitt's character.

Idealism is corrupted and proved almost as irrational as psychosis.","Can you eleborate on that? Help me understand because I'm not entirely sure why things happened the way they did in the movie.","It's actually pretty simple, Brad Pitt proves Kevin Spacey right, but Morgan Freeman rededicates himself to justice, so maybe he was wrong too. I suppose the point is that anyone can succumb to dark impulses, not just someone who is insane.","Ok what is seemed like Kevin Spacey's character was almost punishing Brad Pitt for a Sin that he was going to commit in the future, which I think sort of plays against his ""holy"" reasoning for the murders he committed.","You're thinking way too much into the script. Keep it simple, The only reason this is sticking out in your mind is because there isn't a solution.","Why didn't Brad Pitt just kill himself at the end?","x",""

You didn't answer my question.","The point of the coin is there to portray the randomness of the entire film. Remember Chigurh? Well he used the coin as a weapon but remeber the scene where Anton uses a penny to remove some screws?","What does the coin have to do with Chigurh and Anton?","Anton Chigurh is seemingly the perfect tool, nothing stops him in his quest to do whatever it is he wants to do, but he still busted by nature and this proves he is a mortal man. The same is shown by the use of the coin, it can be used in a multitude of ways, but in the end the coin is still a coin.","x",""
