A lot of people don't take any effort to make themselves look nice.","I sort of agree. We should take pride in our appearance, but overall we need to focus less on appearance and more on the content of the character of the person.","You know what trend I think is funny? In ads for men's clothes, they're starting to make the men pose in more and more ridiculous ways, the way they do women.","It is funny to see a guy advertising a suit, standing in the rain with an unopened umbrella, or laying on the floor in a warehouse.","But the same pressure women have felt to be as thin as fashion models is also starting to effect men, they think they're supposed to look like fashion models.","People don't understand that fashion advertisements use a lot of tricks: camera angles, photoshop, lighting, makeup, all just to get the perfect shot.","It's unfair that now they photoshop almost every fashion model's picture or celebrities' pictures. They take attractive people and impose impossible standards on them like tiny waists.","I'd like to see a more healthy look in fashion advertising. It would be nice to see models that aren't so impossibly perfect and unrelateable.","I know, I really like the trend of using plus sized models.","Why do you say that?","EVen though plus sized is really just the size of the average American woman! It should be called real sized.","I think they are immodest and show too much skin.","Do you really think they're that different than the previous generation?","They probably are only slightly more immodest in the way they dress than the previous generation,","I think the previous generation showed just as much skin. Our culture is constantly pushing us to dress sexy.","That's true. Teens are taught to glamorize the way celebrities dress without realizing that the average person dressing that way could be harassed or get into trouble.","I don't think all current fashion is bad. I really like the uneven hemline trend in tops, dresses and skirts.","I do too. And I think the cold shoulder trend is cute without being overly sexy or exposing too much skin.","",""

However, I would go with Thunderball the midnight blue dinner jacket he wore was a very classic look.","The original bond girl of course! Ursula Andress, and her white bikini she looks beautiful!","Fine, any other favorite Bond outfits?","In Skyfall Daniel Craig wore a shawl collar jacket that while stylish worked well with the darker tones of the movie.","There have also been some pretty badly dressed characters in the movies though.","Yes indeed, at least every film set in warm weather seems to feature someone with a mismatched tropical outfit of some kind.","Bond sure has evolved his style over the years.","It's been interesting he's worn everything from ivory jackets to tweed.","I feel like a lot of men like to sometimes copy his style don't you think?","",""
