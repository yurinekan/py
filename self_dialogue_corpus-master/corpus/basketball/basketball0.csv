A penalty may occur when a player pushes another player, a foul.","What happens when a penalty occurs?","Depending on the location of the penalty, penalty shots may be awarded.","What is a penalty shot?","A penalty shot provides the player that was fouled with two shots into the hoop from the top of the key. The other players must stand on the side of the key and not defend their basket.","Sounds like penalty shots could allow a team to make lots of points.","Each penalty shot is only worth 1 point.
