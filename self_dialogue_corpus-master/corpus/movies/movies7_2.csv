The Rock voices one of the main characters, and he was a hoot to listen to!","That's good to hear! Usually sequels let me down after making me wait for them to be released.","I totally get what you're saying, but this one was definitely good. It might even be funnier than the first one.","I love that! I always thought one of the best aspects of the first Guardians movie was how much I was laughing when I saw it.","Oh, if you thought that one was funny, you HAVE to see Deadpool.","Is that the one with Ryan Reynolds? I remember seeing trailers for it.","Yeah, Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, and it's literally the most hilarious superhero movie to come out yet, in my opinion.","I'll definitely have to add that to my list of movies to check out.","",""
