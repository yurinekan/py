However, I really want to ignore the canon explanation of the sequels that he's the result of some cult activity.","Does that mean you don't take the Halloween sequels as canon?","Yes and no. I take the second as canon because it directly continues the story and I take H20 as canon for the same reason, but I don't quite believe a lot of what they ask you to believe for the others.","Did you know they used an altered William Shatner mask to make the original Michael Mask?","x",""

That's what kills people every year who go too far out.","Back then, parents were a lot more conservative about what they let kids watch on tv and at the movies.

I asked him if his dad lets him watch those movies at home, and he said yes and was telling me all about them to prove he's watched them. He's only six years old.","Six is too young to be watching movies like The Fast and The Furious. He should be watching Disney movies at that age.","His dad would probably let him watch the Jaws movies then if they are on this summer.","I was 14 and my parents wouldn't let me go to the movies and see it.","I probably would let a 14 year old watch Jaws, but not a six year old.","To tell the truth, it's probably better I didn't watch it back then. I was the type to scare easily and have nightmares. I still don't watch scary movies nowadays.","But you're comfortable now with Jaws?","Well, last summer when I was watching it, I was sitting really close to the tv, and talking to my daughter and son-in-law. I wasn't paying close attention, and I looked over at the screen, and suddenly the shark jumped up on the screen, and I jumped back. Everyone had a good laugh at me.","Uh oh, just like the movie Jaws.","Oh how funny. I would have laughed too.","Yep, it's that time of the year. Every July, the sharks are out and so are the people on the beaches. That's why they play the Jaws movies all month long every year.","That shark in Jaws was so fake looking.","Well, these sharks aren't fake. They said three years ago they counted eighty sharks, and last year they counted 147.","Why are the great whites increasing so much? Does it have something to do with global warming?","No, they said it's because since the 70s they have been trying to help conservation of gray seals, and that's what the great whites eat.","According to the Jaws movie, they like to eat people.","I wasn't allowed to watch the Jaws movies when they came out.

I found both were good, and both had different takes, including different supporting characters.","That's interesting, I hadn't seen the earlier version, do you know who stars in that version?","English actors, Anton Walback, or something like that.  It was made just a few years before the Hollywood version.","That's interesting, I think I will Google it and check it out.  It sure is fun to explore movies, isn't it!","Yes!

The casting was incredible.  I think that film inspired future comedies, things like the Pink Panther, and all those other Mel Brooks films.  Do you have a favorite Mel Brooks film?","I would say The Producers, the original one.  I also liked Young Frankenstein.","Those were gems!  I must admit that I found Blazing Saddles wildly funny.  I thought the second version of The Producers was okay, but lost something compared to the original.  Why is it when they re-do a movie it is rarely as good as the original?","Beats me, but I totally agree.  There have been some lousy remakes.","Oh, here's one that comes to mind, Sabrina.  That was a perfectly fine Audrey Hepburn/Humphrey Bogart vehicle, but when they remade it, it was just sad.","x",""

Classics of Carpenter can get a little weirder -- like, say, Big Trouble in Little China.","I've heard of that. I... don't know what it is.","Even if you watch it five times, you won't be much the wiser. Kurt Russell is a truck driver who stumbles into a magical cult in San Francisco's Chinatown and satirically Joe Americas all over the place.","Sounds... interesting.

And Carpenter's equivalent to Burton's Danny Elfman is, uh, John Carpenter. His scores are like his films: no-budget, absurdly simple, yet fascinating and effective.","Didn't expect the Orson Welles analogy to go so far.

The Thing, presumably; Halloween...","Those are highlights, right. Funny thing is, you're going to think of horror, but Carpenter has done just about every genre in the book, often one right after another.","Is his non-horror stuff... good, at all?","Some of it! You need to understand that every movie he's done, with few exceptions, has been painfully underfunded and produced under crippling creative conditions.","One of those situations, huh. Like Orson Welles, Terry Gilliam?","More so, if you can believe it. He had a period where Hollywood considered him potentially bankable, but even then his interesting stuff was mostly independent and scraped together out of dirt and spit.","Dude, I'm already sold.

But he did make the team due to his dedication.","Some people who have seen the movie might forget that the title of the movie came from Piccolo's college team's ""fight song.""  unfortunately i can't remember what college Piccolo went to, but as a rookie on the Bears, he had to stand up on a table and sing it.","Oh, i have to admit i had forgotten that.  Yes he stands right up on a table and sings the song with all his teammates laughing like crazy.","a big part of that movie was when Sayers got seriously injured and Piccolo motivated him in his recovery from a leg injury.","that's right.  when Sayers got injured, as i recall, Piccolo replaced him in the lineup, knowing that when Sayers recovered, Piccolo would revert to backup status.","x",""

It's pretty much the only one that stands alone as a functioning piece of cinema.","Well, he did plan out most of the movie with toys. But, basically, yeah, that's the level he's working at, dramatically.","So what's the other reason for that trainwreck? They'd already shot the footage or something?","That's it exactly; they didn't have a plan, so they just shot people running around in a field, doing action stuff. Then later, they basically made the sequence in the studio by editing together bits and pieces that looked interesting and tying them together with CGI or pick-ups or some ADR.","Seriously? Did the Aragorn idea come before this or after it?","I don't know. But that's why there's so much of it. Same thing for Helm's Deep; they just shot in the mud, at night, for, like, a month, and then tried to make something out of all the footage they had.","Did they throw any away? Because... that's kind of interminable.","Oh, they threw away a ton. Originally Arwen was supposed to be there, fighting alongside the Fellowship. They had to edit around that.","Wait, what? Is that why all those elves show up for no reason?","Yeah, he had to leave some of that thread in because there already were elves in the background of so many shots and he wasn't going to go back and reshoot that nightmare.","So... after he got the third movie it sounds like he later tried to pull closer to the book, but he was stuck with the footage he had, and had to make the best of the changes he couldn't dial back?","Yeah, that's true. It's also just better-made than the sequels.","That's basically the story of this whole project, yeah. Then the changes took on lives of their own, and to justify them he had to keep building on them in the next movie -- and even referencing some of that stuff in the Hobbit trilogy.","I remember at the time everyone talking about how The Two Towers was the rare ""middle"" film that didn't drag in comparison to the surrounding films. But I can think of plenty of examples of other middle films that work, and TTT is just... spinning its wheels most of the time.","It makes sense, when you consider Jackson had planned the whole thing as two movies, and filmed a large part of that, before it was split into three. This is the movie made of pieces trimmed out of the start and the end.","So it's literally just the cuttings of Fellowship and Return of the King, built out into a full movie? Because that's what it feels like.","More or less. And not even that; Jackson had to throw away a lot of stuff he shot for the events covered in the second book, because of liberties he took to compress the story into two movies.","He already took his share of liberties. What the hell is the point of the warg battle, where they pretend to kill off Aragorn?","Yeah, there are a couple of things about that. One is that Jackson is not a very subtle artist, and he was convinced the movie lacked drama because none of the major characters died in it.","What is he, twelve?","x",""

I still can't be fully convinced of the Hulk for some reason, but it's really amazing.","Do you think they rely on CGI too much in these movies?","A little, yes, but with this material you almost have a necessity for CGI.

I think CGI is the way to go, but they need to work with it more to make it more realistic.","I think the movies in the universe have gotten better and better with each new movie because that allows for more characters to cross over into other movies.","I agree. The fact that Iron Man plays such a big role in Spiderman Homecoming is really great.","Do you think they might be going for too much too fast? They might overload the audience with too many characters and backstories.","True, but I think the writers have done a fantastic job of integrating these characters without the audience needing to go back and watch their specific movie in order to understand who they are.","That still leaves the problem of having too many characters, though.","I think most of the movies do a good job of restraining themselves in that regard. Even though it's also Marvel, the other side of the Marvel Universe movies don't seem to be succumbing to the same issue X-men started to have.","I agree, X-men just seemed like they wanted to jam in as many characters as humanly possible in their movies.

I liked Ant-Man a lot so I wonder how it would have been different with Edgar Wright.","The good thing about Edgar Wright movies is you know a lot of work went into each shot.

Well, that didn't help it sound any less ungrateful.","Can you imagine how much money she has made thanks to those movies?","I looked up her earnings. She's listed number four for the top five Fast and Furious earners. She made 5 million for Furious 6, and Paul Walker and Vin Diesel each made 15 million.

But people pointed out how it seems wrong to say the movies don't value the women.","Charlize Theron had a huge main part in the current movie I know, and the women in the guy's lives always have lots of lines and feature in the action.","They even drive the cars just as good as the guys do, it's not like they put them in the passenger seat and act like women can't drive.","Do you think maybe she was jealous because her part wasn't as big as Charlize Theron's?","I think she has kind of a big head and thinks she's a bigger celebrity than she is.
