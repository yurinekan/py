It takes place in New York, America. So we get to see the culture difference between England and USA.","I guess I did hear something about that, now that you mentioned it. Something about non-wizards being called no-mag instead of muggles.","yeah, that is one of the differences that people have been talking about but I think the bigger differences is that in America wizards and witches aren't allowed to marry or even be friends with the no-mag just so the secret of magic won't leak.

Man, that is rough.","Yeah, I guess this is one of the reasons grindelwald is trying to 'liberate' witches and wizards, and the threat of him is really real throughout the movie.","x",""

I mean that they have good acting, expansive sets and costuming, a fantastic story, and some educational value too.","Well I guess that is the teacher in you showing through.","I'm not a fan of old movies except for musicals.","Hmmm...I suppose it is.","What musicals do you like?","I like Camelot, The King and I, My Fair Lady, and The Sound of Music.","Which is your favorite?","I don't think I have a favorite because I like them all for different reason.","What kind of reasons? Can you be more specific?","Well, I like Camelot because I love the story of King Arthur and, although it's a little odd for knights to be singing it really tells the story well.","What about The King and I? Is that the one with Yule Brenner in it?","x",""

The whole idea of Godzilla came after World War II and in the wake of Japan having nuclear bombs dropped on their country.","So what else did you like about the film?","Well, it was pretty cool that it was set in a world where they'd never experienced an attack from Godzilla before; so for most of the beginning of the film it's a lot of them trying to figure out what's going on and trying to be cautious about what information people find out before they're sure they understand what's happening.","Yea, that sounds a lot like what a group of scientists or officials would probably need to do in that position.","Exactly, so it's maybe a little slow, but you get sucked into the story because it feels like the real world. They have to deal with nervous officials, a terrified public, and the pain of the memories of how their country was effected by the last major attack on them; our nuclear bombs.","I could see how that realism could bring you into the story.","Yea, and like I said, it is a little slow at times. The way to look at it is this isn't a big Hollywood blockbuster version of Godzilla. This is a ""how realistic can we make something so outlandish"" kind of movie.","It sounds really interesting; you said it only had a limited release in the US?","Yea, unfortunately I guess they didn't have backers for a larger release.","That's a shame, but I guess it will become more available once it's out on dvd.","The last movie I saw in person was Shin Godzilla (it's a Japanese-made film that had a limited US release).","I sure hope so; I'll definitely be getting myself a copy as soon as it's out.","Oh nice, I really like all those old Godzilla and other kaiju movies!","Yea, me too. This one was actually really interesting and a lot better than the more recent American-made Godzilla movies that have come out in the last decade or so.","So, what was different about this one?","I feel like this one kind of got back to the way the Japanese Godzilla movies were made, and it actually dealt with a lot of real-world issues.","What kind of issues?","Well, one example is that while Japan was trying to fight off Godzilla themselves, other countries around the world are itching to intervene because they're worried about getting attacked themselves. There was a lot that dealt with how events would realistically take place if a country was under attack by something that they couldn't stop.","Oh true, yea I remember reading that a lot of the early Godzilla movies were actually (fairly disguised) political commentary.","x",""

It's basically about how hard it is to say goodbye. I love it, but it makes me cry every time.","That's fair, I usually don't like sad movies very much. My favorite movie is Jupiter Ascending.","x",""

DC is my favorite, and I love the heroes, but until this latest movie, all were bad.","I think that this will set DC on the right path.

That's one of my all time favorites!","Exactly, it's Joe Pesci's New York/Italian accent, the way he tells the stories, and the way everyone cracks up when he tells them.","I also love all the food in the movie. It makes me salivate!","Me too! I get so hungry, especially when Ray Liotta is cooking that big feast at the end.","The part when Ray Liotta says ""I had some beautiful cutlets I was gonna cook up before dinner just as a appetizer"" always makes me want chicken cutlets.","I also like when they go to Joe Pesci's mother's house and she shows them her painting.","Oh yeah, that part is so funny for unexplainable reasons. Joe Pesci says, ""I like this. One dog goes one way, the other dog goes the other way.""","Yeah it's funny but I don't really know why. Maybe it's his voice again.","Did you know the woman that plays the mother is actually really Martin Scorsese's mother?","No kidding? Wasn't she in Casino too?","Yes, I think she was.","Mine too! I can quote this movie almost by heart.","What a nice bit of trivia. I never knew that.","What's your favorite part of this film?","Oh wow, too many to mention. For one thing, I love the scene with Tommy and Billy Batts.","I like when Billy Bats says ""Go home and get your shinebox!""","Yes! That's such a hilarious scene, even though it's quite brutal too.","I like when they're all sitting around the table in the restaurant, and Joe Pesci is telling stories.","Yes, and they're all laughing hysterically!","It makes you laugh hysterically too, even though sometimes you don't even know the context of the story.","x",""
