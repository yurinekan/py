I had to really gather to process what was going on.","Yeah the sacrifices were really something else. It's a hard movie to watch. Actually it reminds me of the brutal crime stories from the 90's.","What do you mean? I think the movie sets place in the late 80's early 90's actually.","I think that's what they were going for. In the 80's cults were really a big thing so many of the horror and crime stories revolved around that.","I see, that makes a lot of sense.

I think there has to be somewhat of an evil presence or it wouldn't make a lot of sense.","Weren't Emma Watson and Ethan Hawke great in it?","I never thought of it like that. I think I'll have to go back and give Regression a second watch to see for myself.","They really were, and I didn't realize David Thewlis was also in there! He was currently in Wonder Woman.","So, that's where I recognized him from! I remember him from other movies too but couldn't put a name to him, but he has such a recognizable face and English accent.","I wasn't sure about the ending to Regression but I remember you telling me about the movie and how Emma Watson's character was pretty interesting.","What did you think about her performance in the movie and how they shifted her from victim to mastermind?","I was kind of blown away by it because the whole movie, Ethan, was playing the seasoned detective investigating this cult, and Emma seem to be just a victim in all this, but when they revealed she was setting things up, just wow.","I know, I felt so sick when that happened. The whole movie I was feeling so much sympathy for Emma, and then when the reveal happened I felt just like Ethan's character.","Did the movie scare you?

While I am always up for hearing Mark Hamill's Joker, and didn't mind in this movie, I do not think it was a total must-have.","It felt like towards the end, of the identity of the Phantasm was revealed, and we had Batman chasing Joker, it almost felt like another episode of the series.","I agree. But that did not make it any less enjoyable.","Definitely not. I think Mark Hamill did some amazing voice work in that movie.","It was another very intense fight scene between the two.

One thing about that movie is do you think it's meant to be a part of the animated series world?","I think it did. Even though the Phantasm was never mentioned again in the series, the story is that Joker was able to escape her at the end.","Okay, that makes sense. That also explains how he is able to still be around for so long in that world.","I am a huge Batman fan and I think in terms of film, he is at the very top!","Absolutely. Either way we look at, when it comes to general Batman movies, mask of the Phantasm is one of the best!","I cannot disagree with that one bit.

We as fans, go to see him put on the gear for the very first time.

It was pretty good, I really enjoyed it.","Did Asa play the boy from Mars and was he an alien?","Not exactly, I mean Asa did play the main actor, but he wasn't an alien. His mom played by Janet Montgomery was the lead astronaut on a team that flew out to Mars to do an expedition at the camp sites NASA had set up there.","Oh that sounds interesting, so he was born in space?","Well he was conceived on the ship during the flight out there, and I guess I'll spoil it, his mother dies from child birth. He ends up growing up on Mars with the dreams to visit Earth.","Wow, that's a really good concept. I really liked him in Ender's Game and Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children. I also enjoy all of Gary Oldman's performances. Britt Robertson was a friend in this movie?","Britt Robertson plays his only friend. She's a student on Earth and they communicate via chat daily.

Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller had such great chemistry and they all had really good character backgrounds and growth throughout the movie.","I'm in the middle. I can't really decide, both were exceptional movies. I felt with The Spectacular Now, Miles and Shailene's performances were so good, plus it had Brie Larson too.","Brie played Miles ex-girlfriend right?","Yeah she's more of a minor character but her character really sets forth the motivation for Miles character to grow up.","Maybe the feel good moments in Perks of Being a Wallflower were more powerful for me.

Basically John Gallagher Jr. is a random stalker or predator that happens on the property and starts to terrorize her.","Oh wow she's deaf and mute, and this is a thriller? This sounds like a really good movie for me.","It's so suspenseful and I thought the whole set up was so original too. How often do we get a movie where the protagonist is both deaf and mute!","I know! I'm curious to know how she manages to survive or at least battle through this scenario.","It's really well done because the suspense is top notch. The quality of the sound is so rich. They want us as the viewers to be empathetic of Kate's situation, as being a victim being hunted.","I can't imagine how I would manage that situation if I had those impairments. That's why this movie sounds so good to me.

He also directed the recent Ouija Origins and I didn't think anybody could do that after the mess that was the original Oujia movie.","He's so good. You need to catch his earlier works if you haven't had a chance. Oculus and Absentia are so terrifying.","Oh I've been meaning to watch that! I heard it's so good. It stars John Gallagher Jr. and Kate Siegel right?","I haven't watched them yet but I'll get on that, but I'll start with Hush because that sounds so intriguing to me!","They're both in there, that's right. John Gallagher has been in so many movies of late and Kate Siegel appeared in a handful recently too.","I remember John Gallagher from Short Term 12 with Brie Larson. Fantastic movie!","He was also in 10 Cloverfield Lane as well as The Belko Experiment!","I've watched 10 Cloverfield Lane and that was so good and suspensful. I haven't watched the Belko Experiment yet but I remember you telling me it was a very entertaining watch.","Definitely check the Belko Experiment. It was a lot of action, tension, suspense, and just overall fun. Things get crazy in that movie.","I don't remember what else Kate Siegel was in?","She was in Ouija Origins. It was a brief role but she was the first psychic customer that shows up. The man's wife.","x",""

It sounds really interesting as well as intense. I'll have to put it on my list.","I highly recommend it. I think the performances were top notch and the score and cinematography painted a really good feel.","Do you remember who directed it?","Niki Caro directed it.

She directed that Kevin Costner movie, McFarland, USA and also North Country starring Charlize Theron.","Yes Jessica Chastain plays Antonina Zabinski the wife of Dr. Jan Zabinski played by Johan Heldenbergh. They're a couple living in Poland running a local Zoo.","I heard this movie was set in the 1940's during the Hitler and Nazi reign.","That's correct.

It's very suspenseful and tense and it's actually from the same director as Clouds of Sils Maria.","Is that the one with Kristen Stewart?","Olivier Assayas! That's the director. I love his style.

It's a smart indie movie but it's really well done.","That's right! I recently watched Swiss Army Man, and that was a crazy movie, but she was the Paul Dano's main object of attraction.

The one thing you had in common is now gone, so how are you going to make this relationship work?","Exactly, that's the driving plot point and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as well as Aaron Paul do such a convincing job that you almost feel ashamed to be watching because you feel like you're intruding on their private moments.","Well that's the sign of good acting and a good strong screenplay when the movie can actually take you there emotionally.","I was definitely emotionally invested in the movie because it hit so close to home. The pain and loss, as well as the struggles you see on their faces, so touching.","They're both terrific actors and I'm sure this movie gave them the perfect playground to showcase that talent. I really want to see this movie.","You definitely should. It's a slow burn, but the dialogue is so good. There's light hearted moments but things turn dark quickly too.","Who's in that movie?","Thanks for the heads up.

They don't realize it as drinking is just their way of life but it affects so many things in their relationship.","Okay I'm in if Mary Elizabeth Winstead is in it and now you mention Aaron Paul I'm in too. I didn't realize Aaron was getting so many parts now. Must be because of Breaking Bad!","Well he was in a lot of other movies before like The Last House on the Left, and Mission Impossible 3, as well as some other small movies but nobody knew he was at that time!","Unlike Mary Elizabeth Winstead or MEW, everyone knows her right away!","Who couldn't recognize Ramona Flowers!

I wasn't happy with it at all.","Did it get too cheesy?","Not exactly, although some of the dialogue was very bad, the cheesiness wasn't there exactly, but the writers, directors tried to outsmart themselves.","What do you mean by that? I hope Mandy Moore survived I really like her.","They have dream sequences and twist endings, so it's one of those things.","The current shark movie with Mandy Moore out in theaters?","Oh, I've never liked it when movies trick me. I might still give it a watch later on though since I like shark movies and Mandy Moore.","That's the movie. I watched it last night with my girlfriend.","Did you enjoy it?","I thought it was suspenseful and the shots in the water with the sharks was terrifying but overall I didn't enjoy the movie as much as I enjoyed The Shallows.","The Shallows was also a shark movie but starred Blake Lively right?","Yeah that's correct. It came out last year and I really liked that movie. Blake was stuck on that rock with the shark surrounding her after the attack while she was surfing.","I remember that. I really liked that movie too. So tell me about 47 Meters Down.","Mandy Moore and Claire Holt play sisters who go on a vacation to Mexico. They decide to go scuba diving in a shark cage but the cage falls down and they're stuck at the bottom of the ocean.","x",""

The movies last year were so much better.","I could not believe when the pods started to arrive in that movie. Amy Adams was great in the role studying the pods and trying to figure out what the creatures were saying.","This is exactly what I'm talking about. There is depth to the story line. It is not just about blowing things up and shooting people.","I have to say however that I did not love La La Land last year.","Really? Why not? It was up for Best Picture at the Academy Awards?","I liked the musical aspect of it. However, I could not believe they cast as the two main characters Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling.","What was wrong with them? They are great actors.","That is exactly the problem. They are great actors but they can't sing or dance.","Oh. You have a point there. It is a musical where singing and dancing is the primary aspect of the film.","Why could they have not cast people who can sing, dance and act?","Well, I think that makes the point that many of these movies today are made purely for economical reasons.","I agree. I am hoping that after the summer the quality of the movies will start to improve. I am getting tired of all the action films.","You have summed up the entire problem with the current selection of movies. It is about how much money can the movie make and not the quality of the art or story.","If I have to see one more Marvel superhero or Fast and Furious sequel, I will be annoyed.","The concept that sequels are the most desirable movies is ridiculous. How many times can we see an Alien, Spiderman or Pirates of the Caribbean movie?","I really miss movies like Sing Street or Moonlight.","You are so right.  I want to see a movie that has some substance and intrigues the mind.","When I saw last year Manchester by the Sea I almost cried. The depth of the characters' personalities that were revealed was astounding.","I loved that movie.  The experiences that the characters lived through really gripped you and created a lot of conversation.","I also loved The Arrival. Even if it had a science fiction aspect, it still told a great story.","x",""

He essentially looks like a demon with glowing eyes.","That sounds silly, but also in a scary kind of a way.
