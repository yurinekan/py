You're bringing in that notion from the outside.","The outside of what?","At its core, film is just about the juxtaposition of imagery over time. Color adds another visual dimension that can distract from the composition and values created from strict light and shadow.","But it's all two-dimensional.

It's a created universe, so why insist that it operate like the real world?","I mean, all this black-and-white stuff. It's so... stagey, and slow.","Some of it, yeah.

On a mass scale, let's say the 1950s -- but there was color film way back in the silent era.","So why did it take so long to catch on?","A bunch of reasons. The early technology was unstable and hard to use; for a long time it was way more expensive; and it was seen as a gimmick more than a strict improvement.","Seriously?

I remember when the movie came out, and everyone was discussing the accuracy of it.","I remember too, and I think it's still agreed to be the most accurate scene of the landing on film.","Which is utterly terrifying, when you think about it.","And of course, Tom Hanks does a great job as always.","",""
