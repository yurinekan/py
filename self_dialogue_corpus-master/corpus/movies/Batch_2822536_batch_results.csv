She's been in a handful of movies too but more as a supporting character. She's usually the girlfriend character, or friend of the main character. Pretty girl, and has great screen presence.","The name sounds familiar but I can't put a face to it.","Off the top of my head, she was in Paper Towns, from a year ago, as well as some other fun movies. I really like her too and see a promising future for her.","What did you watch? I need some new movie recommendations!","Okay, I think I know who you're talking about and I agree, she's got talent! That's a a good pairing. I'll give Before I Fall a watch this weekend!","Well, I watched this really interesting movie called, Before I Fall. It stars Zoey Deutch, Halston Sage, and this young actor I've seen before but can't recall his name.","Oh, I really like Zoey Deutch. Did you know she's Lea Thompson's daughter? You remember her right, from Back to the Future, Howard the Duck, a lot of great 80's movies.","Yes! I did know that. Ever since being introduced to her in Vampire Academy and learning a bit about her background I've been trying to catch all her films. She's doing great and appearing in a lot of notable movies currently!","So tell me about this movie, Before I Fall!","That's right, well let me tell you, this movie is quite the mind bender. It'll keep you guessing how things will play out and it will definitely entertain you the whole way through.","Is this a drama or more of a mystery thriller? I haven't caught one of those in awhile.","This is a little of both, I'd also add in fantasy to it. It's based on a popular novel by Lauren Oliver, and this story basically centers around a teen girl who basically has to live the same day over and over again!","",""

You can tell me about them if you'd like.","Alright, then. Basically it's about a guy living in a ghetto neighborhood in Southern California that experiences conflicts particularly on Friday.","The series, or just one movie?","Basically the whole series.

Take one more guess.","Did you get to see Jackson dress up in goofy clothes like Jamie Foxx did in Django?","Close, that is close enough. I will tell you- everyone was wearing winter clothes, and they looked really cool.","What is so cool about winter clothes? Didn't people just wearing rugs and basically anything else they could back then to keep warm?","No way, there were tons of cool clothes back then just as there are now.","What were they wearing?","For instance, and I think this is the best by far, Jackson was a former Union soldier, and he goes around wearing his old military uniform which was thick, made him look like a giant, and it had a cape.","",""
