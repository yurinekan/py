I'll leave it there!","Is there any other big  name stars in it?","No one as big a Monroe, that's for sure.

She is very fresh faced in the movie!","Why do you think it's one of her lesser known roles?","Well, like I said, it is very early in her career, and she is not all ""sexed"" up like she was in other films. The theme is also dark, about suicide, and I think it might scare some people. I also admit, sometimes it borders on the melodramatic, but, I really love it! I love seeing her playing a serious role like that.","I can see some parellels between Nell's character and Monroe's own personal life, can't you.","I'd have to say, ""Don't bother to Knock"".","For sure! I think that's another reason why I like it so much. I can only imagine how much she gleaned from her real life to play the role, and it makes it that much more special of a performance.","That's not one I hear too often! What do you like the most about the movie?","I know, usually people say ""Seven Year Itch"" or ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes""! But, I love her character in the movie, Nell.","What is Nell Like?","Very different from Monroe's other characters! She is a young woman who was just released from the mental hospital after attempting suicide because her husband was lost overseas during World War Two.","Wow, that sounds dramatic, not like the light hearted comedies she was in before. What is the main storyline, without giving away any spoilers!","It is very dramatic, almost a dark noir, sort of like ""Niagra"" in a way. Well, the main storyline is that her Uncle works as a elevator man and is letting Nell have a gig babysitting one of the guest's childern while they attend some banquet.","Seems interesting already!","x",""

The 21st century has really tried to step away from history, and even the films are somehow lacking in their substance.","I agree; the stars of today are only shadows of the former glory of Hollywood.","Some films still have a cinematic ambiance.

Legend holds that Max Schreck, who played Count Orlok, drank real blood to get into the role.","Spooky! Bram Stoker's widow tried to have all the prints destroyed because F.W. Murnau broke copyright laws by taking advantage of the Dracula storyline for his version.","I'm glad that prints were saved, though! It's about a hundred years old, and still has an eerily creepy ambiance about it.","Werner Herzog made SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE in the '70s, which also alluded to the blood-lust.

I know people who are not fans at all of wrestling but really enjoyed it.","I heard Mickey Rourke actually won an Oscar for his performance?","I want to say he did, but I am not 100% sure.

I wonder if she kept in touch with her costars in that movie, Paul Newman and Robert Redford.","When I was a kid, we used to watch the Three Amigos over and over. We thought it was hilarious.","Paul Newman was one of my favorite actors of all time. I've heard they're going to use his voice in the upcoming Cars 3.","That was pretty funny, something to watch after a scary movie to help you fall asleep.","I remember watching it after sitting through An American Werewolf in London.  Without something like Three Amigos to watch, I never would have fallen asleep.","After watching A Nightmare on Elm Street, I remember watching The Breakfast Club to help me fall asleep.","I saw The Breakfast Club just recently. It had a group of actors who were part of a group called The Brat Pack.","I remember them, young actors at the time.  Some of them, like Demi Moore hit it big in the entertainment business.","I think I can remember them all; Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy.","They made some good movies. The one that sticks out the most to me is St. Elmo's fire.","x",""
